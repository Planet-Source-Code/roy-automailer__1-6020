## AutoMailer


</div>

### Description

A.K.A. The Spam-o-matic. This app uses the Microsoft MAPI Controls 6.0. You must be running Outlook for this code to work. I originally used it as an automatic remailer for a web site. It has been modified to use an Access database to store e-mail addresses of 'recipients'. The program will only mail ONE message per user as is. This is great for mass mailings. Or code can be modified to mail multiple messages to a single address. Please, only do this to friends who will appreciate it! Code uses a timer so mail is sent by default only once every 10 seconds. If you're at work I would recommend NOT lowering the timer. Any questions, e-mail me. Please don't ask for new features. I will post bug fixes as necessary. --Please rate me if you like this code, it will encourage me to upload more neat apps.--
